Selenium WebDriver supports various browser drivers, each designed to interact with a specific web browser. Here are the commonly used browser drivers in Selenium:

ChromeDriver:

Used for automating Google Chrome browser.

Can be used on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

GeckoDriver (Firefox):

Used for automating Mozilla Firefox browser.

Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux.

InternetExplorerDriver:

Used for automating Internet Explorer browser.

Primarily used on Windows.

MicrosoftEdgeDriver:

Used for automating Microsoft Edge browser (Chromium-based version).

Supported on Windows and macOS.

SafariDriver:

Used for automating Safari browser.

Built into the Safari browser on macOS. Additional setup is required for Windows.

OperaDriver:

These browser drivers act as a bridge between the Selenium WebDriver and the respective browsers, facilitating communication and enabling automation of browser actions.

It's important to note that each browser requires a specific driver version that is compatible with the installed browser version. Additionally, keeping the browser drivers up-to-date is crucial to ensure compatibility and avoid issues with automated tests.
