Both exceptions and errors are types of Throwable,but they are used to represent different kinds of problems in a Java program.

1. Exception;
   - Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program and can be handled by the program.
   - They are typically caused by the application itself, either due to incorrect input, logic errors, or unexpected conditions.
   - Exceptions in Java are divided into two categories: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions.
     -Checked Exceptions: These are exceptions that are checked at compile-time. The programmer is required to handle or declare them. Examples include IOException, SQLException, etc.
     - Unchecked Exceptons: Also known as runtime exceptions, these exceptions are not checked at compile-time. They usually indicate programming errors, such as attempting to access an array index that does not exist (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException) or dividing by zero (ArithmeticException).

2. Eror:
   - Errors, on the other hand, are events that occur during the exection of a program and are not typically recoverable.
   - They are often caused by external factors or problems that are beyond the control of the application, such as system failures, resource exhaustion, or severe runtime issues.
   - Unlike exceptions, errors are typically not meant to be caught or handled by the application. They indicate serious problems that may require the termination of the program.
   - Examples of errors include OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError, and VirtualMachineError.

exceptions are used to handle events that a program might reasonably be expected to catch and recover from, while errors indicate more severe issues that may not be recoverable. Exception handling in Java provides a mechanism for dealing with excetional conditions and maintaining the normal flow of the program, whereas errors usually indicate issues that might be byond the program's control.
